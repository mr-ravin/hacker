<p align="justify">
Ravdec is a module written in python, which is based on a Lossless Data Compression Algorithm designed by Ravin Kumar on 19 September, 2016.This compression algorithm have a fixed compression ratio of 1.1429 in all possible cases, It accepts data of following format: alphabets,numbers, and symbols.It can be used where the machine generates data at a very fast rate, that it became difficult for other algorithms to calculate the propability of a symbol, as data keeps on getting large, and is transmitted over the network with a much faster rate. In this case also, the above module, and algorithm gives the same compression ratio.

<p align="justify">An opensource library written in python for performing secret-sharing among two parties.
